Description:Quick and straightforward visualization of read signal over genomic intervals is key for generating
  hypotheses from sequencing data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, bisulfite/methyl-seq). Many tools both inside
  and outside of R and Bioconductor are available to explore these types of data, and they typically start
  with a bigWig or BAM file and end with some representation of the signal (e.g. heatmap). profileplyr leverages
  many Bioconductor tools to allow for both flexibility and additional functionality in workflows that end with
  visualization of the read signal.
